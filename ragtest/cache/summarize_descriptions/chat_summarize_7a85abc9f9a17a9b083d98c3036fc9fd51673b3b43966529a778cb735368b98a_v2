While they share this fundamental purpose, they differ significantly in their specific approaches to constructing the tree, particularly regarding dataset splitting and feature handling.\n\nThe primary distinction lies in their splitting strategies and methods for evaluating the purity of a dataset split. ID3 uses the Information Gain metric, which is based on the concept of entropy from information theory, to select the best feature to split the data on at each node. In contrast, CART employs the Gini Impurity index to evaluate splits, aiming to minimize the impurity of the resulting subsets.\n\nFurthermore, their feature handling capabilities differ. ID3 is designed to work exclusively with categorical features. CART, however, is more versatile as it can handle both categorical and numerical features directly, making it applicable to a wider range of datasets. Another key difference is the type of tree they generate; ID3 produces multi-way trees, where a node can have more than two children, while CART produces strictly binary trees, where every internal node has exactly two branches.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1759933573, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ffc7281d48_prod0820_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 218, "prompt_tokens": 183, "total_tokens": 401, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 55}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
