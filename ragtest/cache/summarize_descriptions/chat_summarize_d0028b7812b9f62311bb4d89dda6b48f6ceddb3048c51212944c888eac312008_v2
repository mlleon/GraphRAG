It was designed to address several significant limitations of its predecessor. A key enhancement is its ability to handle both continuous and discrete variables, whereas ID3 could only process categorical data. For its splitting criteria, C4.5 uses the concept of information gain, which is based on information entropy, to evaluate the purity of potential splits. To correct for a bias that information gain has towards attributes with a large number of values, C4.5 introduces the use of the information value (or gain ratio), which normalizes the information gain and provides a more balanced metric for selecting the best attribute to split on. Furthermore, the algorithm incorporates a tree pruning mechanism, which is a technique to remove non-critical branches after the initial tree is built. This post-pruning process is a crucial feature that helps to mitigate the problem of overfitting to the training data, resulting in a decision tree that is simpler and more likely to generalize well to unseen data.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1759932973, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ffc7281d48_prod0820_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 214, "prompt_tokens": 250, "total_tokens": 464, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 122}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
