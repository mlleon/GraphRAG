A key characteristic of CART is that it creates binary splits at each node, meaning it partitions the data into exactly two subsets. This algorithm is versatile in its ability to handle both discrete (categorical) and continuous (numerical) features. For continuous variables, CART employs a specific method of identifying the optimal split point by evaluating the midpoints between adjacent values in the dataset.\n\nCART is one of several decision tree algorithms and is often distinguished from others, such as ID3 and C4.5. The primary differences lie in its approach to selecting split points and its method for partitioning the dataset, which contributes to its unique application in both classification and regression tasks.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1759933093, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ffc7281d48_prod0820_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 159, "prompt_tokens": 232, "total_tokens": 391, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 104}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
