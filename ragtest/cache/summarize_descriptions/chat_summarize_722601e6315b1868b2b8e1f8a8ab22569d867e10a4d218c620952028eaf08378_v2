It serves as the predecessor to the more advanced C4.5 algorithm. A key characteristic of ID3 is that it can only handle datasets with discrete variables. For feature selection, the algorithm uses the concept of information gain, which is derived from information entropy. This metric serves as the evaluation criterion for determining the optimal way to split the dataset at each node in the tree. Consequently, the data is partitioned based on the values of the selected discrete attributes to build the decision tree model.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1759932913, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ffc7281d48_prod0820_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 110, "prompt_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 326, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 88}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
