To handle INCOME, which is a continuous variable, the ID3 modeling process requires a discretization step to transform it into categorical ranges before it can be assessed. When evaluated using the information gain metric, which quantifies the effectiveness of a variable in reducing entropy, the INCOME column achieved a gain of 0.026.
